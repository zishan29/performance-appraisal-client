            The faculty performance appraisal has been designed with the key
            deliverables of faculty members in mind. This appraisal form has
            five categories, which are as follows:
          </div>
          <ol className="ml-5 list-decimal">
            <li>Academic Involvement</li>
            <li>Student Development</li>
            <li>Administrative Bucket</li>
            <li>Research Bucket</li>
            <li>Consultancy and Corporate Training Bucket</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            There are some key elements of this performance appraisal form that
            you should be aware of before filling it out. These components are
            as follows:
          </div>
          <ol className="ml-5 list-decimal">
            <li>Performance Category - The main category of performance</li>
            <li>
              Performance Parameters - Sub category under the main category
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance criteria with quality benchmarks - Standards of
              perfomance
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Quality benchmarks and weightages have been defied for almost all
          performance parameters. For a few performance parameters, however,
          each criterion is directly mapped with absolute marks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless otherwise specified, each faculty member is required to fill
          out data relevant to the period of performance appraisal
        </li>
        <li>
          Faculty members are required to complete the &apos;Faculty
          Information&apos; sheet with their information.
        </li>
        <li>
          The summary page is linked to entire form, and once the faculty has
          completed the entire form, the data will be refelected on this site.
          The summary sheet allows faculty to view the total score for each
          category.
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>Please keep the following in mind while filling the form: </div>
          <ol className="ml-5 list-decimal">
            <li>
              Faculty must respond to the question posed at the start of each
              performance parameter, i.e., &lsquo;Have you performed under this
              parameter?&lsquo; If the faculty member has not performed for that
              parameter, the faculty member must select &lsquo;No&lsquo; from
              the drop down menu. If you choose &lsquo;No&lsquo; the score for
              that parameter will be calculated &lsquo;Zero&lsquo; and you will
              not need to go through the worksheet for that parameter.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have performed more than the specified provision (such as
              the number of courses/labs taught, activities organised, etc.)
              under a specified performance parameter, then you are required to
              explicitly mention the same in the tab &lsquo;Additional
              Work&lsquo;
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            For calculating score for each performance parameter, following
            steps are to be followed
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Step 1: Go to the relevant performance parameter page (for example
              AI-1/AI-2/AI-3 etc.)
            </li>
            <li>Step 2: Observe the criteria for the performance parameter</li>
            <li>
              Step 3: Once you fill all the applicable parameters correctly,
              self appraisal score will be calculated for that performance
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Marks claimed for one performance parameter cannot be claimed again
          for other performance parameter. Links for the relevent supporting
          documents (evidence) are required to be uploaded in the &lsquo;Upload
          Evidence&lsquo; section for being eligible to claim marks for that
          parameter.
        </li>
        <li>
          If faculty memeber teaches the same subject to more than one division,
          only one claim for course content learning resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Faculty Who only conduct lab/tutorial sessions are required to
          consider the respective theory course result for p oint no. SD-2.
