          <li><div>The faculty performance appraisal has been designed with the key deliverables of faculty members in mind. This appraisal form has five categories, which are as follows:</div>
            <ol className='list-decimal ml-5'>
              <li>Academic Involvement</li>
              <li>Student Development</li>
              <li>Administrative Bucket</li>
              <li>Research Bucket</li>
              <li>Consultancy and Corporate Training Bucket</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><div>There are some key elements of this performance appraisal form that you should be aware of before filling it out. These components are as follows:</div>
          <ol className='list-decimal ml-5'>
            <li>Performance Category - The main category of performance</li>
            <li>Performance Parameters - Sub category under the main category</li>
            <li>Performance criteria with quality benchmarks -  Standards of perfomance</li>
          </ol></li>
          <li>Quality benchmarks and weightages have been defied for almost all performance parameters. For a few performance parameters, however, each criterion is directly mapped with absolute marks.</li>
          <li>Unless otherwise specified, each faculty member is required to fill out data relevant to the period of performance appraisal</li>
          <li>Faculty members are required to complete the &apos;Faculty Information&apos; sheet with their information.</li>
          <li>The summary page is linked to entire form, and once the faculty has completed the entire form, the data will be refelected on this site. The summary sheet allows faculty to view the total score for each category.</li>
          <li><div>Please keep the following in mind while filling the form: </div>
            <ol className='list-decimal ml-5'>
              <li>Faculty must respond to the question posed at the start of each performance parameter, i.e., &lsquo;Have you performed under this parameter?&lsquo; If the faculty member has not performed for that parameter, the faculty member must select &lsquo;No&lsquo; from the drop down menu. If you choose &lsquo;No&lsquo; the score for that parameter will be calculated &lsquo;Zero&lsquo; and you will not need to go through the worksheet for that parameter.</li>
              <li>If you have performed more than the specified provision (such as the number of courses/labs taught, activities organised, etc.) under a specified performance parameter, then you are required to explicitly mention the same in the tab &lsquo;Additional Work&lsquo;</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div>For calculating score for each performance parameter, following steps are to be followed</div>
            <ol>
              <li>Step 1: Go to the relevant performance parameter page (for example AI-1/AI-2/AI-3 etc.)</li>
              <li>Step 2: Observe the criteria for the performance parameter</li>
              <li>Step 3: Once you fill all the applicable parameters correctly, self appraisal score will be calculated for that performance</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Marks claimed for one performance parameter cannot be claimed again for other performance parameter. Links for the relevent supporting documents (evidence) are required to be uploaded in the &lsquo;Upload Evidence&lsquo; section for being eligible to claim marks for that parameter.</li>
          <li>If faculty memeber teaches the same subject to more than one division, only one claim for course content learning resources.</li>
          <li>Faculty Who only conduct lab/tutorial sessions are required to consider the respective theory course result for p oint no. SD-2.</li>
        </ul>
